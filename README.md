# HR_Retention
 A Project predicting employee retention
This project is about predicting the employees who are most likely to leave a company. I use two different approaches: (1) Logistic regression and (2) Tree-based machine learning (random forest and decision trees). In these approaches, ‘last_evaluation’, ‘number_project’,  ‘tenure’ and ‘overworked’. were the top four factors likely to make an employee leave the organisation.
